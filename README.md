# Analyzing Crime in Vancouver

## Ryan Saloff, Yash Mirani, Aditya Bakshi, and Eva Ma

Data analysis report of Vancouver's crime rate in **R**. [(https://github.com/plat0cracy/Inferential-Analysis-of-Vancouver-Crime/blob/main/Analyzing%20Crime%20in%20Vancouver.ipynb)].

🧹 Gathered and processed 20 years of crime data from the BC Police Records Management System. Implemented data cleaning and wrangling techniques to ensure data integrity. 

🔎 Employed asymptotic and bootstrapping approaches to investigate the change in the rate of theft and break and enter in Vancouver over 20 years using over **800,000+** crimes. Furthermore, for each crime of interest, we conducted a permutation hypothesis test and an asymptotics test.

📊 Visualized the probability of our findings through practical confidence intervals and null distributions. Identified a statistically significant decrease in break and enter crime rates from 2004-2008 and 2018-2022 in both the permutation hypothesis test (p = **0.031**) and the asymptotics test (p = **0.027**).

🤝 Translated statistical analyses into actionable recommendations, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding crime patterns and trends.
